#Recommendations based on data

Most regions in the world are increasing forest area. 
--The only regions not increasing are Latin America & Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa. 
--These two regions decreased forest area percentage from 1990 to 2016. 
--The change in the world forest area percentage shows how impactful the decrease in forest area from 
--Latin America & Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Afric was.
--Focusing on countries that had the highest amount decrease in forestation shown in the 
--"top 5 amount decrease in forest area by country" query and the highest percent decrease shown in the "top 5 percent decrease" query 
--would be a great place to stop the decline in forestation. I would also recommend communicating with China to see 
--what they are doing to increase the amount of forestation so drastically would be very helpful.
